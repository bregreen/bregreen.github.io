    "\n",
    "   An API allows us to extract and interact with data directly from websites as well as other social networks, applications, and projects that make their data publicly available. They are built for data-sharing purposes and help to promote the use and further development of a site and its data. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Twitter wants other developers to use, integrate, and build upon Twitter tools and data. The Twitter API is the main conduit by which these developers can do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The API can provide structured data as organized by the site itself -- You can be a bit more confident about the data you are pulling from an API.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   However, sometimes sites will restrict data access or require payment because __**$$**__.\n"
