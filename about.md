# About Me

<br>
<br>

## Prounouns

She, Her(s)

## Interests

* Computational Social Science
* Identity Development

## First Gen Scholar

I am a first-generation college graduate, and I will be the first person in my family to earn a Doctorate degree. That holds incredible weight for me, and I seek to mentor future scholars throughout my journey.


## Non-Negotiables

I am a Black woman who examines the online communities of individuals and organizations that may not respect my humanity, due to said characteristics. I also actively seek to advance the diversity of academia and technology, and spend time uplifting underserved populations. Given these points:

* If you are an event organizer or journalist asking me to speak on a panel or to be interviewed, please provide general information about fellow panelists or the interviewer.
* I'm more than happy to chat with anyone about graduate school, and especially if you identify as a woman, first-generation and/or a person of color (but not limited to these groups). If you would like to ask questions about applying to graduate school or my experiences, please reach out via email or find me on Twitter.
* I will always be unabashedly myself, in all my forms. If I cannot bring my whole self to the enviroment, it is likely that there may not be a reason for me to be in the space. Thus... you can find my twitter below which encompasses both the personal and professional thoughts I would like to share.
