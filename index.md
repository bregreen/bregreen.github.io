# Welcome

A fifth year [Information Science](http://infosci.cornell.edu/) PhD candidate at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) advised by [Drew Margolin](https://www.communication.cals.cornell.edu/people/drew-margolin/).

Generally, I'm interested in the ways both activist and extremist identities and ideologies are built and maintained using various social media platforms. This interest lead to a desire to examine the way moral language is utilized to condemn or justify political violence. Specifically, my dissertation will examine how politically motivated actors moralize acts of harm (i.e. political violence). I employ semi-supervised and unsupervised learning methods to examine text as data, particularly from sources such as Twitter, YouTube and Gab.

Before arriving to Cornell, I earned both my B.S. and M.S. in Psychology from [Prairie View A&M University](https://www.pvamu.edu/cojjp/departments/psychology/) and the [University of Texas at San Antonio](https://hcap.utsa.edu/psychology/), respectively.

After UTSA, I spent a few years working as a Research Analyst in the Institutional Research department of a large community college in Texas.
