# Welcome

A third year [Information Science](http://infosci.cornell.edu/) PhD student at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) advised by [Drew Margolin](https://www.communication.cals.cornell.edu/people/drew-margolin/).

I'm interested in the ways in which both activist and extremist identities and ideologies are built and maintained using various social media platforms. I employ semi-supervised and unsupervised learning methods to examine text as data, particularly from sources such as Twitter, YouTube and Gab. 

Before arriving to Cornell, I earned both my B.S. and M.S. in Psychology from [Prairie View A&M University](https://www.pvamu.edu/cojjp/departments/psychology/) and the [University of Texas at San Antonio](https://hcap.utsa.edu/psychology/), respectively.

After UTSA, I spent a few years working as a Research Analyst in the Institutional Research department of a large community college in Texas.
