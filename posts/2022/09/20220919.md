## TLDR

  Psychology, Information Science, Political Science, Communications? At this point, my actual field of study is blurry even to me. 
  
  I recently attended the American Political Science Association Conference held in Montr√©al, which was one of the first bigger conferences I've been able to attend as a doctoral student who started their graduate journey in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e. completely virtual). Feeling a bit alone and out-of-place as an Information Science student among Political Scientists, I had ample time to reflect on where I was situated (figuratively and literally).
