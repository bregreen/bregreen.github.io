## TLDR

  Psychology, Information Science, Political Science, Communications? At this point, my actual field of study is blurry even to me. 
  
  I recently attended the [American Political Science Association](https://www.apsanet.org/) Conference held in Montr√©al, which was one of the first bigger conferences I've been able to attend as a doctoral student who started their graduate journey in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e. completely virtual). Feeling a bit alone and out-of-place as an Information Science student among Political Scientists, I had ample time to reflect on where I was situated (figuratively and literally).
  
### Fields

  + **Psychology** -- the study of the mind and behavior
  + **Communications** -- the study of human messaging, whether through verbal or non-verbal methods
  + **Political Science** -- the study of theoretical and/or practical aspects of government and politics at varying levels (local, state, national, international)
  + **Information Science** -- *a bit more abstract*, the study of information systems as they relate to social, cultural, economic, legal, historical and political contexts
  
  Somewhere within these four fields you will find me sitting on a chair swinging my short legs. If you, reader, so happen to engage with one of these fields, please feel free to claim your favorite color of the four.

### Situatedness

  When I share my background is in Psychology as opposed
to other computing fields, people are usually surprised! If you scan my [home page](https://bregreen.github.io/) you'd see I earned both my B.S. and M.S. in Psychology from [Prairie View A&M University](https://www.pvamu.edu/cojjp/departments/psychology/) and the [University of Texas at San Antonio](https://hcap.utsa.edu/psychology/), respectively. I've known I was going to study psychology since the fourth grade -- no seriously, I have a collage poster project about "Future Me" where I said I planned on being a psychiatrist by 22. While missing the mark on that lofty timeline, I never wavered in my first field of choice. I love *nearly* everything about the field and knew I would thrive in that area. At the time, it was also pretty evident to me that holding solely a Bachelors in Psychology wasn't going to do a lot for my future career trajectories and graduate school was always in the cards.

  Thankfully, coming out of my Masters I was quickly offered a role as a Research Analyst. I worked in this position for close to three years, with an amazing team and the best boss in the world! There I learned to code (SQL, Python, R), how to work with administration/faculty/staff and the local community, developed my leadership skills, and had a salary that could at least pay my student loans and let me survive. I was more than happy; inching closer and closer to the "settled and content" space of adulthood. ***Yet*** grad school was ever-looming in the back of my mind. Finally, one day I broke down and admitted to my boss that I needed to go... I needed to try grad school, whether or not I would actually stay. Without hesitation she supported and encouraged me -- I cannot thank her enough to this day. 
  
  Initially, I considered applying only to Communications programs for graduate school because it seemed like they were using methods of interest or working on fascinating problems. I won't spend this post discussing how I applied to grad school or how I decided to apply to Cornell (if I do in the future, I'll link it here), but I will say I didn't know of Information Science before 2020! Whatever the case, I applied, I got in, and here I stand. Cornell Information Science is curious hodgepodge of sorts, which is probably why I fit strangely well. My main advisor is situated in the Communications department while my minor members are a blend of Government and Psychology. So, we return to the question: what am I? Psychology, Information Science, Political Science, or Communications?
