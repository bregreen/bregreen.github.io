## TLDR

  Psychology, Information Science, Political Science, Communications? At this point, my actual field of study is blurry even to me. 
  
  I recently attended the American Political Science Association Conference held in Montr√©al, which was one of the first bigger conferences I've been able to attend as a doctoral student who started their graduate journey in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e. completely virtual). Feeling a bit alone and out-of-place as an Information Science student among Political Scientists, I had ample time to reflect on where I was situated (figuratively and literally).
  
### Fields

  + Psychology -- the study of the mind and behavior
  + Communications -- the study of human messaging, whether through verbal or non-verbal methods
  + Political Science -- the study of theoretical and/or practical aspects of government and politics at varying levels (local, state, national, international)
  + Information Science -- *a bit more abstract*, the study of information systems as they relate to social, cultural, economic, legal, historical and political contexts
  
  Somewhere within these four fields you will find me sitting on a chair swinging my short legs. If you, reader, so happen to engage with one of these fields, please feel free to claim your favorite color of the four.
