## TLDR

  Psychology, Information Science, Political Science, Communications? At this point, my actual field of study is blurry even to me. 
  
  I recently attended the [American Political Science Association](https://www.apsanet.org/) Conference held in Montr√©al, which was one of the first bigger conferences I've been able to attend as a doctoral student who started their graduate journey in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e. completely virtual). Feeling a bit alone and out-of-place as an Information Science student among Political Scientists, I had ample time to reflect on where I was situated (figuratively and literally).
  
### Fields

  + **Psychology** -- the study of the mind and behavior
  + **Communications** -- the study of human messaging, whether through verbal or non-verbal methods
  + **Political Science** -- the study of theoretical and/or practical aspects of government and politics at varying levels (local, state, national, international)
  + **Information Science** -- *a bit more abstract*, the study of information systems as they relate to social, cultural, economic, legal, historical and political contexts
  
  Somewhere within these four fields you will find me sitting on a chair swinging my short legs. If you, reader, so happen to engage with one of these fields, please feel free to claim your favorite color of the four.

### Situatedness

  When I share my background is in Psychology as opposed
to other computing fields, people are usually surprised! If you scan my [home page](https://bregreen.github.io/) you'd see I earned both my B.S. and M.S. in Psychology from [Prairie View A&M University](https://www.pvamu.edu/cojjp/departments/psychology/) and the [University of Texas at San Antonio](https://hcap.utsa.edu/psychology/), respectively. I've known I was going to study psychology since the fourth grade -- no seriously, I have a collage poster project about "Future Me" where I said I planned on being a psychiatrist by 22. While missing the mark on that lofty timeline, I never wavered in my first field of choice. I love *nearly* everything about the field and knew I would thrive in that area.
